# arduinoMIDIplayerOrgan
A project to create an Arduino based MIDI player system for reed organs or pianos


This is the firmware for my Arduino based player reed organ system: designed to have MIDI input and output, allow the easy addition of extra controls and plugins, and ideally capable of adaptation to any reed organ or even piano (so long as you can figure out the hardware side of doing that).
Bear in mind that this is a personal project created as part of my EPQ artifact. As such, it may not stay updated forever and might be riddled with bugs or not work on your system. But hopefully not!
