# arduinoMIDIplayerOrgan
A project to create an Arduino based MIDI player system for reed organs or pianos

Currently, the Master version is a normal C++ program I used to develop the core features for easier debugging, and is used for developing new plugins. It has a command line interface. THIS DOES NOT COMPILE FOR ARDUINO. For that, view the arduinoPort branch, which has significant changes just to make compiling possible.
